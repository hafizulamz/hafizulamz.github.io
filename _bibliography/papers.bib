	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to serve as a comprehensive review of the existing annotated corpora. This review study aims to provide information on the existing annotated corpora for event extraction, which are limited but essential for training and improving the existing event extraction algorithms. In addition to the primary goal of this study, it provides guidelines for preparing an annotated corpus and suggests suitable tools for the annotation task.
	Design/methodology/approach: This study employs an analytical approach to examine available corpus that is suitable for event extraction tasks. It offers an in-depth analysis of existing event extraction corpora and provides systematic guidelines for researchers to develop accurate, high-quality corpora. This ensures the reliability of the created corpus and its suitability for training machine learning algorithms.
	Findings: Our exploration reveals a scarcity of annotated corpora for event extraction tasks. In particular, the English corpora are mainly focused on the biomedical and general domains. Despite the issue of annotated corpora scarcity, there are several high-quality corpora available and widely used as benchmark datasets. However, access to some of these corpora might be limited owing to closed-access policies or discontinued maintenance after being initially released, rendering them inaccessible owing to broken links. Therefore, this study documents the available corpora for event extraction tasks.
	Research limitations: Our study focuses only on well-known corpora available in English and Chinese. Nevertheless, this study places a strong emphasis on the English corpora due to its status as a global lingua franca, making it widely understood compared to other languages.
	Practical implications: We genuinely believe that this study provides valuable knowledge that can serve as a guiding framework for preparing and accurately annotating events from text corpora. It provides comprehensive guidelines for researchers to improve the quality of corpus annotations, especially for event extraction tasks across various domains.
	Originality/value: This study comprehensively compiled information on the existing annotated corpora for event extraction tasks and provided preparation guidelines.},

	abstract = {The novel Deep Neuro-Fuzzy System (DNFS) has attracted significant attention from researchers due to the model's adaptability and rule-based structure. The model has been successfully implemented in various real-world applications. However, despite its success, the DNFS experience difficulties applying high-dimensional data. The rule base in the DNFS expands exponentially with the number of features affecting the transparency of the model. Additionally, the typical gradient-descent (GD) technique used in the DNFS rule-base optimization frequently encounters the issue of being trapped in local minima. This study aims to introduce a modern optimization approach to address these drawbacks. Therefore, the novel Bitwise Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BAOA) has been proposed in this work. The BAOA method has been implemented as a feature selection approach to solve the large rule base problem due to applying high dimensional data. Moreover, the DNFSâ€™ rule base optimization was carried out using the proposed BAOA algorithm to escape the local minima issue owing to the GD algorithm. The simulation results obtained on twelve benchmark datasets illustrated that the BAOA has been able to select the least number of features from high-dimensional data with an average accuracy of 95.53%. In terms of rule base optimization, the novel BAOA achieved better performance with average training and testing accuracies of 96.87% and 96.25%, respectively, on benchmark datasets compared to the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) (average training and testing accuracies of 95.66% and 94.54%) and GD-based optimization (average training and testing accuracies of 94.07% and 93.19%). Additionally, the Wilcoxon test revealed a significant difference between the performances of the proposed BAOA algorithm and comparative methods. The findings indicate that the proposed BAOA approach is highly effective for high-dimensional real-world problems.},

State-of-the-art data mining technologies struggle to process information from textual data. Therefore, various IE techniques have been developed to enable the use of IE for textual data. However, each technique differs from one another because it is designed for different data types and has different target information to be extracted. This study investigated and described the most contemporary methods for extracting information from textual data, emphasizing their benefits and shortcomings. To provide a holistic view of the domain, this comprehensive systematic literature review employed a systematic mapping process to summarize studies published in the last six years (from 2017 to 2022). It covers fundamental concepts, recent approaches, applications, and trends, in addition to challenges and future research prospects in this domain area. Based on an analysis of 161 selected studies, we found that the state-of-the-art models employ deep learning to extract information from textual data. Finally, this study aimed to guide novice and experienced researchers in future research and serve as a foundation for this research area.",

Previous studies indicate that most instructors and students believe the flipped classroom approach improved analytical thinking among undergraduates. Therefore, in order to determine the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach for the development of analytical thinking, 134 UTP undergraduates enrolled in Big Data Analytics (BDA) course are considered as the participants in this study. One complete module with detailed teaching and learning activities (TLA) was developed for an immersive learning experience, and students were provided with pre-class instruction. The performance of the flipped classroom approach was evaluated using immersive learning experiences and a student satisfaction survey. The results show that the flipped classroom approach is successful in developing studentsâ€™ analytical thinking skills among the participants of this study.

Therefore, in this study, we attempted to perform information extraction from textual data using current and state-of-the-art models to understand their working mechanisms. To perform this study, we have chosen the GENIA corpus for evaluating the performance of each model. These selected event extraction models are evaluated based on specific measures which are precision, recall, and F-1 measure. The result of our study shows that the DeepEventMine model has scored the highest for trigger detection with a precision of 79.17{\%}, recall at 82.93{\%}, and F-1 measure at 81.01{\%}. Similarly, for event detection, the DeepEventMine model has scored highest among other models with a precision of 65.24{\%}, recall at 55.93{\%}, and F-1 measure at 60.23{\%} based on the selected corpus.",

Without proper asset management, it will lead to various unexpected scenarios including an increase in plant deterioration, increased chances of accidents and injuries, and breakdown of assets at unexpected times which will lead to poor and hurried maintenance. Given the significant economic contribution of the oil and gas sector to oil-producing countries like Malaysia, accurate asset maintenance prediction is essential to ensure that the oil and gas platform can manage its operations profitably. This research identifies the parameters affecting the asset failure on oil and platform that will be interpreted using the XGBoost gradient boosting model from machine learning libraries. The model is used to predict the asset's lifetime based on readings collected from the sensors of each machine. From result, our prediction method using XGBoost for asset maintenance has presented a 6.43{\%} increase in classification accuracy as compared to the Random Forest algorithm.",

	abstract="Prediction of future crude oil price is considered a significant challenge due to the extremely complex, chaotic, and dynamic nature of the market and stakeholder's perception. The crude oil price changes every minute, and millions of shares ownerships are traded everyday. The market price for commodity such as crude oil is influenced by many factors including news, supply-and-demand gap, labour costs, amount of remaining resources, as well as stakeholders' perception. Therefore, various indicators for technical analysis have been utilized for the purpose of predicting the future crude oil price. Recently, many researchers have turned to machine learning approached to cater to this problem. This study demonstrated the use of RNN-LSTM networks for predicting the crude oil price based on historical data alongside other technical analysis indicators. This study aims to certify the capability of a prediction model built based on the RNN-LSTM network to predict the future price of crude oil. The developed model is trained and evaluated against accuracy matrices to assess the capability of the network to provide an improvement of the accuracy of crude oil price prediction as compared to other strategies. The result obtained from the model shows a promising prediction capability of the RNN-LSTM algorithm for predicting crude oil price movement.",

	abstract="Machine learning technologies have been growing rapidly in recent years. Researchers have come up with several data processing architectures, enabling machines to consume, interpret, and produce understandable output from real-world data to improve the quality of our lives. The NeuCube architecture is a data processing architecture for spatio/spectro-temporal data which consists of four main modules: a spike encoding module, a recurrent SNN reservoir, an output module, and an optimization module. Despite it has been utilised on many various applications, most improvement of the architecture focuses on user experience rather than improving the result accuracy. Upon exploration of the architecture, the weighted k-nearest neighbours algorithm used for the classification module is found to be prone to misclassification as it relies solely on the majority voting rule to determine the class for new data vector. Additionally, it does not consider the class-specific fuzzy weight information during the classification process. Therefore, a data modelling mechanism which implements PIfwkNN classifier algorithm for improving the overall classification accuracy of the NeuCube architecture has been proposed. The proposed data modelling applies an additional class-specific fuzzy weight information to new data vectors during the classification process. In this research, the optimal parameters set for experiments has also been identified. The approach has been validated by using the Kuala Krai Rainfall Dataset, Dow Jones Index Data Set, and Gold Price and Performance Dataset for the 3-days earlier and 1-day earlier event prediction. From the experiments, the improved personalised data modelling using PIfwkNN classifier has shown a significant increase in terms of overall classification accuracy as compared to the conventional MLP, fkNN, and NeuCube with wkNN classifier.",

Most traditional methods for managing employee lack the capability to capture employee attendance in real time, hence unable to track employees' punctuality. In another point of view, the problem may affect the overall performance of the employees in an organisation. iHRMS has been introduced not only to cater the said problem but to assist in delivering a more accurate payroll system, therefore, enabling an organisation to better manage their finance.",
