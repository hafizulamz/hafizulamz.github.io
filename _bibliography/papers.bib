	abstract = {Many real-world problems involve a large number of features, among which several features are irrelevant or redundant. This problem not only increases the dimensionality but also reduces the classification performance of machine learning models. To address this issue, feature selection methods have been extensively used in the literature, either by applying existing algorithms or developing new algorithms. However, many of these approaches suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature reduction due to getting trapped in local minima in the large search space. Hence, this study proposed a recent stochastic optimization-based technique called the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). The OOA algorithm has the capability of balancing exploration and exploitation effectively during the search process, making it suitable for solving high-dimensional optimization tasks. To validate the efficiency of the selected feature subsets, the study employs the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. Comparative results between OOA and five state-of-the-art algorithms show that OOA achieves the highest average classification accuracy of 89.22 %, while selecting the fewest average features of 70.63 and reduces the feature burden by 62.80 %. Moreover, the results of a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test based on classification accuracy show a p-value less than 5.00E-02, confirming a statistically significant difference in performance among the six algorithms.},

	abstract = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) uses optical fiber cables to detect vibrations and record as a strain rate. DAS technology is being utilized in various fields. Its data routinely reaches terabytes. It is difficult to process even a 2 km long cable with a sample rate of 2000 Hz and a gauge length of 1 m produces ∼650 Gb of data per day. This entire cable works as a sensor. However, technology notoriously suffers high noise caused by diverse noise sources from internal (Instrumental), and external (Environmental) disturbances such as anthropogenic and morphological. Resulting in poor Data Quality (DQ) potentially required for machine learning (ML) algorithms. Therefore, this research focuses on addressing issues by removing inconsistencies and irregularities. Additionally, this study proposes noise removal and improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) through ML and data preprocessing techniques, which enhanced data accuracy and reliability for subsurface CO2 leak detection. The proposed model successfully preprocessed the DAS data, improved its SNR, and provided comprehensive DQ reports. The proposed model reduced data by a factor of 3.24 with ∼69.09% space savings, achieving a PSNR of 71.90 dB, indicating better performance and output quality. Furthermore, we compared our proposed methodology with DASN2N. Where our proposed methodology given better performance in terms of SNR ratio.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to serve as a comprehensive review of the existing annotated corpora. This review study aims to provide information on the existing annotated corpora for event extraction, which are limited but essential for training and improving the existing event extraction algorithms. In addition to the primary goal of this study, it provides guidelines for preparing an annotated corpus and suggests suitable tools for the annotation task.
	Design/methodology/approach: This study employs an analytical approach to examine available corpus that is suitable for event extraction tasks. It offers an in-depth analysis of existing event extraction corpora and provides systematic guidelines for researchers to develop accurate, high-quality corpora. This ensures the reliability of the created corpus and its suitability for training machine learning algorithms.
	Findings: Our exploration reveals a scarcity of annotated corpora for event extraction tasks. In particular, the English corpora are mainly focused on the biomedical and general domains. Despite the issue of annotated corpora scarcity, there are several high-quality corpora available and widely used as benchmark datasets. However, access to some of these corpora might be limited owing to closed-access policies or discontinued maintenance after being initially released, rendering them inaccessible owing to broken links. Therefore, this study documents the available corpora for event extraction tasks.
	Research limitations: Our study focuses only on well-known corpora available in English and Chinese. Nevertheless, this study places a strong emphasis on the English corpora due to its status as a global lingua franca, making it widely understood compared to other languages.
	Practical implications: We genuinely believe that this study provides valuable knowledge that can serve as a guiding framework for preparing and accurately annotating events from text corpora. It provides comprehensive guidelines for researchers to improve the quality of corpus annotations, especially for event extraction tasks across various domains.
	Originality/value: This study comprehensively compiled information on the existing annotated corpora for event extraction tasks and provided preparation guidelines.},

	abstract = {The novel Deep Neuro-Fuzzy System (DNFS) has attracted significant attention from researchers due to the model's adaptability and rule-based structure. The model has been successfully implemented in various real-world applications. However, despite its success, the DNFS experience difficulties applying high-dimensional data. The rule base in the DNFS expands exponentially with the number of features affecting the transparency of the model. Additionally, the typical gradient-descent (GD) technique used in the DNFS rule-base optimization frequently encounters the issue of being trapped in local minima. This study aims to introduce a modern optimization approach to address these drawbacks. Therefore, the novel Bitwise Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BAOA) has been proposed in this work. The BAOA method has been implemented as a feature selection approach to solve the large rule base problem due to applying high dimensional data. Moreover, the DNFS’ rule base optimization was carried out using the proposed BAOA algorithm to escape the local minima issue owing to the GD algorithm. The simulation results obtained on twelve benchmark datasets illustrated that the BAOA has been able to select the least number of features from high-dimensional data with an average accuracy of 95.53%. In terms of rule base optimization, the novel BAOA achieved better performance with average training and testing accuracies of 96.87% and 96.25%, respectively, on benchmark datasets compared to the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) (average training and testing accuracies of 95.66% and 94.54%) and GD-based optimization (average training and testing accuracies of 94.07% and 93.19%). Additionally, the Wilcoxon test revealed a significant difference between the performances of the proposed BAOA algorithm and comparative methods. The findings indicate that the proposed BAOA approach is highly effective for high-dimensional real-world problems.},

State-of-the-art data mining technologies struggle to process information from textual data. Therefore, various IE techniques have been developed to enable the use of IE for textual data. However, each technique differs from one another because it is designed for different data types and has different target information to be extracted. This study investigated and described the most contemporary methods for extracting information from textual data, emphasizing their benefits and shortcomings. To provide a holistic view of the domain, this comprehensive systematic literature review employed a systematic mapping process to summarize studies published in the last six years (from 2017 to 2022). It covers fundamental concepts, recent approaches, applications, and trends, in addition to challenges and future research prospects in this domain area. Based on an analysis of 161 selected studies, we found that the state-of-the-art models employ deep learning to extract information from textual data.

Given the significant economic contribution of the oil and gas sector to oil-producing countries like Malaysia, accurate asset maintenance prediction is essential to ensure that the oil and gas platform can manage its operations profitably. This research identifies the parameters affecting the asset failure on oil and platform that will be interpreted using the XGBoost gradient boosting model from machine learning libraries.

Personalised modelling, on the other hand, allows a personal model to be created for a specific data model and experiment. Therefore, a personalised modelling method incorporating spiking neural network is used to create a personalised model for assessing a real-world flood case study in Kuala Krai, Kelantan based on historical data of 2012-2016 provided by Malaysian Meteorological Department. The result shows that the method produces the highest accuracy among the selected compared algorithms.",

Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models captured neuronal behaviour more precisely than a traditional neural network as it contains the theory of time into their functioning model [1]. The aim of this paper is to reviewed studies that are related to clustering problems employing Spiking Neural Networks models. Even though there are many algorithms used to solve clustering problems, most of the methods are only suitable for static data and fixed windows of time series. Hence, there is a need to analyse complex data type, the potential for improvement is encouraged. Therefore, this paper summarized the significant result obtains by implying SNN models in different clustering approach. Thus, the findings of this paper could demonstrate the purpose of clustering method using SNN for the fellow researchers from various disciplines to discover and understand complex data.",

	abstract="Prediction of future crude oil price is considered a significant challenge due to the extremely complex, chaotic, and dynamic nature of the market and stakeholder's perception. The crude oil price changes every minute, and millions of shares ownerships are traded everyday. The market price for commodity such as crude oil is influenced by many factors including news, supply-and-demand gap, labour costs, amount of remaining resources, as well as stakeholders' perception. Therefore, various indicators for technical analysis have been utilized for the purpose of predicting the future crude oil price. Recently, many researchers have turned to machine learning approached to cater to this problem. This study demonstrated the use of RNN-LSTM networks for predicting the crude oil price based on historical data alongside other technical analysis indicators. This study aims to certify the capability of a prediction model built based on the RNN-LSTM network to predict the future price of crude oil. The developed model is trained and evaluated against accuracy matrices to assess the capability of the network to provide an improvement of the accuracy of crude oil price prediction as compared to other strategies. The result obtained from the model shows a promising prediction capability of the RNN-LSTM algorithm for predicting crude oil price movement.",

	school={Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia}, 
	author={Abdullah, Mohd Hafizul Afifi}, 
	abstract="Machine learning technologies have been growing rapidly in recent years. Researchers have come up with several data processing architectures, enabling machines to consume, interpret, and produce understandable output from real-world data to improve the quality of our lives. The NeuCube architecture is a data processing architecture for spatio/spectro-temporal data which consists of four main modules: a spike encoding module, a recurrent SNN reservoir, an output module, and an optimization module. Despite it has been utilised on many various applications, most improvement of the architecture focuses on user experience rather than improving the result accuracy. Upon exploration of the architecture, the weighted k-nearest neighbours algorithm used for the classification module is found to be prone to misclassification as it relies solely on the majority voting rule to determine the class for new data vector. Additionally, it does not consider the class-specific fuzzy weight information during the classification process. Therefore, a data modelling mechanism which implements PIfwkNN classifier algorithm for improving the overall classification accuracy of the NeuCube architecture has been proposed. The proposed data modelling applies an additional class-specific fuzzy weight information to new data vectors during the classification process. In this research, the optimal parameters set for experiments has also been identified. The approach has been validated by using the Kuala Krai Rainfall Dataset, Dow Jones Index Data Set, and Gold Price and Performance Dataset for the 3-days earlier and 1-day earlier event prediction. From the experiments, the improved personalised data modelling using PIfwkNN classifier has shown a significant increase in terms of overall classification accuracy as compared to the conventional MLP, fkNN, and NeuCube with wkNN classifier.",
