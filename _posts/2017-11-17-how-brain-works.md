Currently, I am working in spiking neural networks, the third generation of neural networks which is designed to behave and process information in the way a human brain does.

Therefore, I have decided to write a simple note on how the brain works in layman’s terms…

#### First, we need to know these simple truths (Facts):
<ul>
	<li>The brain is used to store information (knowledge and events)</li>
	<li>We are able to retrieve information stored in the brain</li>
	<li>Retreival of information, however, does not allow the exact information to be “rehearsed or replayed” from the brain, but rather an “appoximate”; it is retreived by the process called memory reconstruction.</li>
</ul>

#### Additional knowledge:
<ul>
	<li>Reconstruction of memory allows the brain to consume less storage to store an event. Several “alike” events and knowledge is stored in a similar, but particular location of the brain.</li>
	<li>Connectivity within several adjescent neurons triggers memory or “senses” to be processed and understood.</li>
</ul>

#### Hence, to sum it up, the the brain works in such (a romantic story):
<ol>
	<li>Our sensory organs receives stimuli from our surroundings. For example, you are looking at a beautiful young lady in a decent blue dress.</li>
	<li>The “knowledge” is sent to our brain by a connective neuron tissue called the spinal cord (spinal cord is located in the middle of our backbone).</li>
	<li>Received knowledge of event is then processed by the brain, by which some part of the brain learns that it is a beautiful lady in a decent blue dress, which you are looking at. Some other part of the brain might try to catch your previous “alike” memory, if exists.</li>
	<li>…then you go back home and go to sleep…</li>
	<li>The next morning, you came across beautiful friend of yours, and that reminds you of the young lady you met yesterday, but you could not exactly recall her face. Why this happens? The similar part of the brain which process the image of the lady you saw yesterday is re-activated once you saw an “alike” image (of your beautiful friend). Your brain is capable of reconstructing your memory of the lady, but not the exact image of her face.</li>
	<li>By employing the mechanism of memory reconstruction, not only it allows the brain to save lots of space, but allows it to predict or project future event possibilities. Nearby connected neurons will be activated, in that case.</li>
</ol>
